Description: This package provides tools for simulating the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) 
    model, a fundamental model in epidemiology for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. 
    It includes functionality to set up the initial state, parameters, and time frame for the 
    simulation, execute the model, and visualize the results over time. The package uses a 
    class-based approach for managing model data and uses the deSolve package for solving 
    ordinary differential equations.
